# Event Schema Registry

## Overview

Documents versioning strategy for OperationEvent types to ensure backward compatibility and safe migrations.

## Current Schema Version

- **Version**: 2
- **Target**: 1 | 2 union type
- **Compatibility**: V1 events auto-convert to V2

## Migration Path

- V1 → V2: No breaking changes; all V1 events remain valid
- All new events created with V2 schema
- Legacy V1 events automatically migrated on load

## Versioning Conventions

- Schema versions in OperationEvent.schemaVersion as discriminated union
- Migration functions in eventMigration.ts
- No event payload changes between versions

## Implementation

See `src/domain/events/eventMigration.ts` for migration utilities.

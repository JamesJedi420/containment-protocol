# Event Schema Registry

## Overview

Documents versioning strategy for OperationEvent types to ensure backward compatibility and safe migrations.

## Current Schema Version

- **Version**: 2
- **Target**: 1 | 2 union type
- **Compatibility**: V1 events auto-convert to V2

## Migration Path

- V1 → V2: No breaking changes; all V1 events remain valid
- All new events created with V2 schema
- Legacy V1 events automatically migrated on load

## Versioning Conventions

- Schema versions in OperationEvent.schemaVersion as discriminated union
- Migration functions in eventMigration.ts
- No event payload changes between versions

## Implementation

See `src/domain/events/eventMigration.ts` for migration utilities.

## IncidentImpact Schema (spe-820.v1)

Documents the canonical typed vocabulary for incident consequence data (SPE-820).

**Current version**: `spe-820.v1` — discriminant on `IncidentImpact.schemaVersion`

**Location**: `src/domain/templates/incidentImpact.ts`

### Standard metric fields

Ten canonical fields with typed denominator semantics:

| Field | Denominator kinds |
| --- | --- |
| `affectedPopulation` | `people` |
| `fatalities` | `people` |
| `rescueDemand` | `people` |
| `shelterDemand` | `people`, `households` |
| `outages` | `customers`, `households`, `services` |
| `facilityImpact` | `facilities` |
| `serviceDisruption` | `customers`, `services`, `organizations` |
| `hazmatExposure` | `people`, `distance_km` |
| `organizationImpact` | `organizations` |
| `jurisdictionImpact` | `jurisdictions` |

All fields are optional. Each metric carries optional `denominator`, `uncertainty` (level + basis), and `note`.

### Extension fields

Non-standard metrics go under `extensions: Record<string, IncidentImpactExtensionField>`. Extension fields are isolated from canonical fields and do not affect standard metric reads.

### Clone safety

`cloneIncidentImpact()` produces a deep copy — all metric `denominator` and `uncertainty` objects are cloned. Runtime mutations cannot leak back into authored template or `IncidentState` data.

### Versioning

- No migration path defined yet (single version)
- If a breaking field change is needed, bump the discriminant string and add a migration function alongside `eventMigration.ts`

## PersistedStore Schema

Documents the versioned serialization format for the full game store state.

**Current version**: `GAME_STORE_VERSION = 6`

**Location**: `src/app/store/runTransfer.ts`

**Migration**: `migratePersistedStore(raw, version)` — handles incremental upgrades from older versions to version 6.

### Notes

- On load, the persisted payload version is checked against `GAME_STORE_VERSION`
- Older payloads are migrated forward via `migratePersistedStore`
- Missing or unrecognised version causes fallback to a fresh store

---

## SaveFile Envelope Schema

Documents the versioned envelope wrapping persisted save files.

**Current version**: `GAME_SAVE_VERSION = 1`

**Location**: `src/app/store/saveSystem.ts`

### Notes

- Save files with `version > GAME_SAVE_VERSION` are rejected (written by a newer build)
- Save files with `version < GAME_SAVE_VERSION` may still be loaded if the inner store migration handles them
- No explicit migration function at the envelope level; version guard is rejection-only
